# SysID Major Assignment
MATLAB Code for Parameter Estimation Project

Contains files for the input simulation and data recording via XPlaneConnect. An additional code is provided for doing regression via Ordinary Least Squares to estimate aerodynamic derivatives from recorded measurements that are neccessary for the aim of this assignment. Alternative code for using Kalman Filter and files (input and output) for the USAF Stability and Control DATCOM are also available for the calculation of the estimators as comparison against the predicted parameters.
